# Thermapool

Thermapool is a pool temperature monitoring app. It uses a REST API to upload temperature readings from a thermometer placed in a pool.

The app allows users to:
- Switch between **Light** and **Dark** modes  
- Toggle temperature units between **Fahrenheit** and **Celsius**  
- View a **history page** that tracks pool temperatures over a specified time period selected in the settings
